JQeuery is messy, trainwrecks delux. very similiar to DoTween lib.

Making games in html/css/js is a nightmare. Might be ok in Playcanvas engine (webgl engine, www.playcanvas.com).

Happy i didn't go with initial where timeboxing ended up to 4month. go small and practice.

1-2 day project is enought like this one, should make another bigger one during christmas break to practice more vanilla js, or just make a website so i don't go down in the game-rabbit-hole again.

Need to let the DOM breath for some milliseconds when switching between 'animate-classes' for resets and checks. 

Have to look if JS have any kind of "out paramter" in functions to work with. Ref/in/read/out etc.

Fun to see that css-spritesheets work similiar to 2D-Unity. Maybe some skinning can be coded for rigs.
