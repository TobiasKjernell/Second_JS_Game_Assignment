regular expressions can solve and save time, need to use it more in some other usecases when needed. Cannot use this in Unity/UE or anything with framerate or gpu calc engines since it's too heavy for the current render/rate.

still missing generic/linq from c#. 

Should make a replica/inspiration game of Hearthstone if there's not any other deadlines in same scope. (For the second js-game with css/html)

Still trying to reach some c# and also Unity functions, need to remap some thinking.

Spend some more time with regular expressions.

prompt and alert freezes all DOM changes, doesn't matter if you make changes above. Event chain seems to be paused until next frame.

the foreach on array and do ' element = 0 ' in array doesnt work. Only with for-loop. Works abit different than C#'s foreach.
